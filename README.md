# rt_gpu_accel
This is a quick demonstration of how Blender can be used, when compiled as a python module, as a method for achieving hardware accelerated ray tracing in GIANT.

# Installation
A script has been included for automatically building and installing blender as a python module on Ubuntu systems.  For other systems, see the Blender documentation.  If you're on an ubuntu system, simply run `install_bpy.sh`
